💠 Chronos Symposium 2026

Architecture of Pure Thought.

Chronos Symposium is a high-end, immersive multi-page web experience designed for a futuristic intellectual exchange. It explores themes of temporal integrity, neural-interfacing, and planetary logic through a sophisticated, glassmorphic user interface.

🌌 The Vision

Built for thinkers like Parithi, this platform serves as a sanctuary for the recursive nature of time. The project focuses on a "Single-Page Application" (SPA) architecture that utilizes state-driven navigation to provide a seamless, high-performance user journey without page reloads.

🚀 Features

State-Driven Navigation: Smooth transitions between Vision, Sessions, Orators, and Registration views.

Glassmorphic UI: Modern design utilizing backdrop blurs, subtle borders, and deep radial gradients.

Responsive Architecture: Fully optimized for all device horizons (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop).

Dynamic Orator Gallery: Stylized cards with hover-zoom effects and intelligent image fallback systems.

Interactive Elements: -   Custom cursor-parallax background movement.

Animated "Event Horizon" entrance effects.

Full registration flow with visual success confirmation.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3

Styling: Tailwind CSS (via CDN)

Typography: Space Grotesk & Plus Jakarta Sans (via Google Fonts)

Logic: Vanilla JavaScript (State management & DOM manipulation)
